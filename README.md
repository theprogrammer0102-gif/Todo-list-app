Hello, this is a Todo-list app made by Python. I has to json files: 
1) Tasks.json, this file saves every single task that wwe have added.
2)  history.json, this file basically saves every single changes that we have made in our app, like adding a task, removing a task, updating a task, etc..
I have tried to make this app very intractable through the terminal with very easy to follow CLI menu.
You can try this code in your own code editor to see how it works!
Thanks for having a look on my project.
